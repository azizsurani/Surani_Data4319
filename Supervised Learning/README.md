Supervised learning - basic steps:
Data Collection - Start with training data for which we know the correct outcome provided by a teacher or oracle. In this case: images for which we know the object category.
Representation - Choose how to represent the data.
Modeling  - Choose a hypothesis class - a set of possible explanations for the connection between images and categories. This is our model of the problem.
Estimation - Find best hypothesis you can in the chosen class.
Model Selection - We may reconsider the class of hypotheses given the outcome.
Each of these steps can make or break the learning outcome.
